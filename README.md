Hi, I'm Carlos, for many years I work as System Administrator on a large company in my country,
managing a lot of Linux servers on several Data Centers, providing great support, SLA and security for it.

Now with the progress of tecnology and theirs challengers, my principal role is Lead SRE, this provide me keep
working with the top and prominent tecnologies.

In the pass, I was an active Open Source evangelist doing talks and organizing masive related events.

I like programing a lot, but the years in the hardware stuck me a little, but I work hard to change that soon :)

Keep rocking ðŸ¤˜
